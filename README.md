Theme:
My chosen theme is Gaming Collection. I created a website that showcases some of my favorite games, such as Dragon Ball Z, Grand Theft Auto, Need for Speed, and God of War.

What I Learned:
While building this project, I learned how to:

Use semantic HTML elements like 'section', 'nav', and 'figure' to structure content.

Style layouts with CSS, including floating images, creating boxes, and adding a linear gradient background color.

Make images the same size using CSS properties.

Apply media queries to make the design responsive on smartphones.

Write a README file to explain my work.
